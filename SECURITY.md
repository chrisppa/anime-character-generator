# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the `main` branch. Report vulnerabilities against the latest commit on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT disclose security issues publicly. Instead, use one of the private channels:

- GitHub Private Vulnerability Report:
  https://github.com/chrisppa/anime-character-generator/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use the advisory flow, open a minimal issue without sensitive details and a maintainer will follow up with a private channel.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- We aim to provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- Fix timelines vary with severity and complexity; we strive for a prompt resolution.
- We will credit reporters who responsibly disclose, if desired.
